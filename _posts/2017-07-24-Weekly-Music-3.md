Hello again! Thanks for dropping by. This is the third installment of my weekly music topic. I'll try to keep these descriptios brief. The 'Artist Name - Song Title' is a link to the artists official website or bandcamp page. Enjoy!



[The Beatles - Strawberry Fields Forever][TheBeatles]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="0aX9-dhii3o" %}
I have this totally new band that I just discovered guys! It'll totally blow your mind! Alright... yeah, I know, everyone knows The Beatles, but c'mon, they're the greatest band of all time. But seriously, I don't believe anyone who says "I don't like The Beatles." That person is broken, and cannot be trusted.



[Botch - Transitions From Persona To Object][Botch]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="q6Q87LFycXI" %}
Botch was a relatively short lived Metalcore (I hate that word) pioneer band from the late 90s and early 00s. This song appears on the album We Are The Romans (1999) and was probaly ahead of its time by eight or ten years. If you are a fan of modern metal, it's important to check out this act that greatly influenced much of the music that is around today. 



[Jim Guthrie - Lone Star][JimGuthrie]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="wOOqdRsbHKA" %}
Jim Guthrie is a multi instrumentalist that appears in the soundtrack to the game Sword & Sworcery (2011) among many other great works. He has A LOT of material out there, and it's really great. This is among the first tracks I heard by him while playing the game Sword & Sworcery a few years back. I was physically taken aback by this song. The placement in the game, and the timing of that melody in the chorus is perfection that garnered a reaction I haven't gotten very often from music. 



[Jurassic - The Way We Do It][J5]
{% include jurassic-5.html %}
Jurassic 5 is this Hip Hop group that's been around forever. They're great, but I don't need to say it, you already know it. This particular song is really hard to find for some reason, but it's wonderful. The sample is from another great song "My Doorbell" by the White Stripes. The combination is intoxicating to me. 


[Mutoid Man - Kiss Of Death][MutoidMan]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="U2OBw-LhNto" %}
Mutoid Man is this band that I love. Featuring the singer/guitar player from Cave In and the drummer from Converge is a recipe for badass. This song is featured on the album War Moans (2017) and it's great, like everything they do. I saw them live about a month ago, and they put on a hell of a show, and have fun doing it. Also, everything Steve Brodsky does is gold, so you'll be seeing a lot of him in these posts. 

[Queens Of The Stone Age - I Appear Missing][QOTSA]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="XvSUaCly0VQ" %}
This is another band you've almost certainly heard of. I've been a fan for a good while now, and I really look forward to their upcoming album. Their previous album ...Like Clockwork (2013) is basically a masterpiece. This is the penultimate track from the album which is almost entirely just as dark as this track. Truly one of the best rock albums of the 2010s.
