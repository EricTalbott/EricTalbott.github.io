Fourth Week. Let's see what I come up with this time! The 'Artist Name - Song Title' is a link to the artists official website or bandcamp page. Enjoy!

[Clouds - Heisenberg Says...][Clouds]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="VFXCgB-saw8" %}
Clouds is a side project from the guitar player Adam McGrath of Cave In. They play fast and heavy, and I love it. This is from one of their second, and final, full album _We Are Above You_ (2008). It's short and hard hitting, and I absolutely love the hook on the chorus. 


[Dillinger Escape Plan - Mouth of Ghosts][DEP]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="0-GbyvP5aFo" %}
Dillinger Escape Plan is a highly influential metal(core) band that's been around since the late to mid 90s. If you've heard much hardcore or metal music in the past 20 years, surely you've come across DEP. They are legendary. This is a song from the album _Ire Works_ (2007) which might rank as my favorite (this or _43% Burnt_). This closes out the album and the build up is just enormous. Anyone who isn't a fan of heavy music, but may have inclinations towards it, this may be a great introduction to the genre, in my opinion. 


[Magnus Palsson - Predstined Fate][Souleye]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="mU-05IjLmss" %}
Of course I must include at least one video game song in my weekly music thread. This is from the game _VVVVVV_ (2010) (the letter 'V' six times), and is written by Magnus Palsson (aka Souleye). The game is one of my favorite games of all time, and so is the soundtrack. The intro to this song is catchy as all hell and I'm always taken back to those rough bouncy section of the game when I hear this great song. 


[Mogwai - Auto Rock][Mogwai]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="jLFd6k1BHDk" %}
Post rock pioneers Mogwai have been around since the mid 90s and are one of the most influential acts around. This song appears on the album _Mr Beast_ (2006) and is very possibly my absolute favorite song by this band. The way this song impacts my emotional state is second to none. Interesting, I suppose, considering it is completely instrumental.


[They Might Be Giants - Instanbul][TMBG]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="dsRuurcTTSk" %}
They Might Be Giants is a wonderful and successful quirky alternative rock band that has been around since the 80s. They have a diverse range of music over the course of 19(!) studio albums. The following lyrics will be stuck in your head for the rest of the day: "Why did Instanbul get the works? That's nobody's business but the Turks." 


[Viktor Vaughn - Saliva][VV]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ylWr1I1FfJ4" %}
Viktor Vaughn is one of the many alter egos of the legendary hip hop master MF DOOM. This is my favorite track from the _Vaudville Villain_ (2003) album, if nothing else because the beat provided by RJD2 is just killer! And of course any rhymes provided by DOOM are just perfection. One of my favorites of the entire grenre.
