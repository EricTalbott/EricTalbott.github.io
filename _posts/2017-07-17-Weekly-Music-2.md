Week two! I'll be keeping my descriptions as brief as I can, because I don't want to ramble. These are presented in alphabetical order, and are from a variety of musical styles. The 'Artist Name - Song Title' is a link to the artists official website or bandcamp page. Enjoy!

[As Eden Burns - Ever Again][AEB]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="xDokTmowSKw" %}
As Eden Burns is a now defunct melodic death metal band out of Houston. This song appears on their only full length album The Great Celestial Delusion (2008). This is one of many great songs from a band that I have personal experience seeing. Way back in 2006/2007 my old band was playing a show at a local bar, we opened up for this band before we'd ever even heard of them. We weren't expecting much, but while we were standing outside, this band began playing and we all dropped what we were doing to confirm our suspicions that a truly amazing band was playing at our local dingy bar the same day we played it. Despite not having a large discography, I continued to love all their music to this day.


[Big Giant Circles - Chips Ahoy Mateys][BGC]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="4WXi0dvjbhY" %}
Big Giant Circles is a sort of chiptune/video game music electronic act that often appears on video game soundtracks. This song appears on the album Imposter Nostolgia (2007) and is just a really fun song. I've been listening to BGC for a couple of years now, and is definitely among my favorite of this style of music.


[Cave In - Retina Sees Rewind][CaveIn]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="udW77WuFlL8" %}
Cave In is my other favorite band. Depending on which album you are listening to, they are either metalcore, space rock, pop rock or hard rock or some combination of these. This song is from their ep Planets of Old (2009). I really enjoy the guitar tone and fast pace of this song. It's hard to say this is indicative of their music as a whole, but it definitely ranks among my favorite songs by this truly great band.


[Flight of the Conchords - Hurt Feelings][FOTC]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="9zI3_pnUU3k" %}
Flight of the Conchords are a popular New Zealand comedic band and HBO show from the early 2000s. This song appears in the episode The Tough Brets (2009). They cover a variety of music genres throughout the show, but this particular song never fails to make me laugh, even though I've heard it many times. 

[Jaga Jazzist - One-Armed Bandit][JJ]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="XgDd9luCWEM" %}
Jaga Jazzist is a sort of jazz group with electronic elements mixed in. I don't have too much to say about them in general, because this is a new discovery for me, and this is the first song I've really heard by them. The song is from their album One-Armed Bandit (2010) and boy is it catchy. I absolutely love it when the bass woodwind sounding instrument kicks in (no clue what it's called, sorry). 


[Madvillain - All Caps][Madvillain]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ewc1hixzYPY" %}
Madvillain is a legendary hip hop collaboration between MF DOOM and Madlib. This song is one of my favorites from the critically acclaimed album Madvillainy (2004). Simply put, if you've never heard Madvillainy and you consider yourself to be a fan of hip hop, you are doing yourself a disservice. This album is widely considered among the greatest underground hip hop albums of all time. Everything from the very creative beats to the unbelievable lyrical skills of DOOM, this is truly a classic.
