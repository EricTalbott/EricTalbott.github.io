Hello there. I have one major fear regarding this website, which is I will create this site then never touch it again. So, in order to force myself to continually work on it, I've decided to include a weekly topic that I am personally very interested in. Before I get into what that idea is, I do want to point out that the main purpose of this site is to keep track of and write about coding projects I'm working on, and other technical topics I am attempting to learn. However, those will be large scale posts that will most likely be rather sparse.

With that said, if you know anything about me, it's that I love me some music. It's one of those really unique things about me. I mean... who else likes music, right? Anyway, this subsection of this site will be used for me to post a weekly 'playlist' of sorts. It will consist of 5-7 songs that I enjoy, and a brief write about my feelings on the songs. I'm not a music critic, so this isn't meant to be taken as critique. I'm also not suggesting that everyone should listen to these songs. They are songs that are pretty much specific to me. I think about music a great deal, so this will simply be an opportunity to express my thoughts about something that I am very interested in. If you find that your sensibilities are similar to mine, and enjoy my write ups, wonderful! Maybe I can turn you on to some new stuff, and maybe you could be kind enough to inform me of something that you think I might enjoy myself.

In each of these write ups, I will embed a youtube video if possible, with a brief description of each song and my feelings about it. I will try to post them in alphabetical order by artist name. I will also try my best to include a fair amount of variety in each post, so it's not all just a bunch of one musical style.
