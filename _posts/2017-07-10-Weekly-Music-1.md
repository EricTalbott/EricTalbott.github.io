So, this is my first week doing this. I'll be keeping my descriptions as brief as I can, because I don't want to ramble. These are presented in alphabetical order, and are from a variety of musical styles. The 'artist - title' is a link to the artists official website or bandcamp page. Enjoy!

[Converge - Sadness Comes Home][Converge]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ncyUDtp_rJk" %}
Converge is a Hardcore/Punk/Metal band that is probably my favorite band. I've been a fan since about 2002, and they've never gotten boring to me once. This song is from their most recent album, All We Love We Leave Behind (2012). The style is quite aggressive, while often having quite catchy melodies like in this particular song. The combination of great production, aggression, and musicianship never fails to impress me.

[Disasterpeace - Synchrosynct][Disasterpeace]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ffqCi99sn7o" %}
Disasterpeace is an electronic act that is often found in soundtracks of indie video games. This song is from a remix album called FZ: Side F (2013), which is a compilation of remixes from the soundtrack to the game FEZ. This is just a catchy song with a good atmosphere that I just can't get enough of it.

[Genghis Tron - Relief][GenghisTron]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="mtTKpRArrS8" %}
Genghis Tron is a sort of electronic grindcore band that has been on hiatus since 2010. This song, from the album Board Up The Houses (2008), is not really a grindcore song, but more doom-esque. I can't really explain it, but despite being a 10 minute song, I always feel like I wish it would just keep going on and on.

[Miami Horror - I Look To You (featuring Kimbra)][MiamiHorror]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="jna2r56EXTg" %}
Miami Horror is a pop rock band with elements of disco and electronica mixed in. I'm bad at describing genre, but whatever. This is the first song I heard by this band, and I'm really glad I came across them. It's from their album Illumination (2010), which is really a great album to me.

[Run The Jewels - Legend Has It][RTJ]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="vWaljXUiCaE" %}
I love RTJ. This rap duo hasn't been around too long, but they've put together three wonderful albums that I just can't get enough of. This song is from their most recent album Run The Jewels 3 (2017), and is one of many greats from the album. I honestly had a hard time picking just one song from it. Everyone should listen to RTJ. This is one group I don't hesitate telling everyone to check out.

[The Shoes - Time To Dance][Shoes]
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="pt9wnawn7xQ" %}
The Shoes are a French electronic group. I'm not going to lie, I only listen to a handful of tracks from this band, however, this one is really fun. The main reason I'm including this on the first of these posts is because it's probably my favorite music video ever. If nothing else, I highly recommend watching this music video. This song appears on Time To Dance EP (2012) comprised of several remixes of their song Time To Dance.
