Hi. I'm Eric. My intention with this blog (let's call it what it is), is going to be to post about topics that interest me. My primary focus will be to post about coding projects that I am working on. This might take some time to get into, because I they will be fairly involved, and I am still learning. I have one or two projects I hope to do a write up on in the near future, so stay tuned for that.

In the mean time, to keep this page active, I will be posting a music topic once a week, where I talk about some of the music I am listening to on a regular basis. I may also consider doing another topic about other media, such as movies, tv, or video games, but that would be much less frequent than the music topic. I may also occasionally post about my own music, if I have any projects worth mentioning.

This is very much a work in progress, to figure out the purpose of all of this. My e-mail is below if you feel the need to contact me for any reason. Either way, Thanks for coming by!

Oh, very important disclaimer! I'M NOT A WRITER! I consider myself to be a subpar writer. Most of my writing is purely stream of conscience. For now, this is just for fun. If this becomes a serious endeavor, I will be sure to improve my writing skills, and find someone to help me write more clearly.
